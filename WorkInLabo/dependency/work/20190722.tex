\subsection*{Organization of Figures}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Modified fontsize of text of the figures
	\item Re-drew 3 types of figures:
	
	1) 5 algorithms for artificial data 
	
	2) 5 algorithms for Google Cluster Data
	
	3) LSE-backtrack with different initial intervals
	
	\item For 1) 2), selected the figures in which the curves of LSE-backtrack and LSE-weighted are better than LSE.
	
	For 3), selected the figures of Approximation in which the curves are converged to 0.
	
	\item Wrote README.txt to indicate the parameters used for the 3 types of figures


\end{itemize}
