\subsection*{Before 01/07}
Before today, I have implemented Deep Q-Learning algorithm training with(out) batch, simple UCB. And I have gotten the results of executing UCB for 20 epochs, 30000 iterations, 100 resources. I have given a presentation of my work in Nokia.

\subsection*{01/07 - 02/07}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rebuilt the \href{https://github.com/TryFire/Intership-in-Lri/tree/master/Deep\%20Q-Learning/src}{code} to separate the part of data and algorithm
	\item Added comments for every variable and function
	\item Wrote the \href{https://github.com/TryFire/Intership-in-Lri/blob/master/Deep\%20Q-Learning/manual/DQN\_Manual.pdf}{manual} for others can use my programme easily.
\end{itemize}
