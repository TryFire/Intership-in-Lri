\subsection*{Correct Errors in Figures Selected}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Corrected the ylabel of figures for Google Cluster Data as what Lorenzo asked
	\item Executed 5 algos for artificial data and selected the figures in which the curve of LSE is close to LSE-backtrack and LSE-weighted

\end{itemize}


\subsection*{Start Deep Q-Learning}

Discussed with Lorenzo, what I start to do with DQN:
\begin{itemize}
	\item 
	
	\item Execute OUCB
	
	
\end{itemize}
