\subsection*{Results of Experimentation for Ext with T=6000}
The calculate of executing algorithm extension with T=6000, epochs=20, 100 resource has been finished, But the result of regret per T Figure \ref{comparisonExtUCB6000} is very strange, I am executing on epoch more to find whether the result of regret is always strange or not.

\subsection*{Modified the Code and Re-execute the Program}
I modified the number of T of every test(extract 10 resources) when I execute algorithm, and it is calculating.

\subsection*{Understand the Program of Stephan}
I have understand the code of algorithms of LSE, LSE-BACKTRACK and how to execute the algorithms.
