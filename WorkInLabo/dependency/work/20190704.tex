\subsection*{Work in Nokia}
Today, I have a meeting with Lorenzo and Johanne in LINCS, and we have discussed the graphs I should do:
\begin{itemize}
	\item For artificial data, modify the 4 functions of simulation for the optimal x isn't always the same(0.5) and make it as a parameter.
	
	\item Execute the algorithms for artificial data and design graphs of regret and approximation.
\end{itemize}
