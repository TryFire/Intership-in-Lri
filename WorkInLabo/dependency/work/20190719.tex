\begin{itemize}
	\item Meeting with Lorenzo.
	\item Try more different intervals for LSE-backtrack. I have tried:
	
	intervals1 = [(0.4,0.45),(0.45,0.5),(0.5,0.55),(0.55,0.6),(0.6,0.65)]

    intervals2 = [(0.45,0.55), (0.55,0.65), (0.65,0.75), (0.75,0.85),(0.85,0.95)]

    intervals3 = [(0.45,0.65),(0.55,0.75),(0.65,0.85),(0.75,0.95)]

    intervals4 = [(0.45,0.75),(0.5,0.8),(0.55,0.85),(0.6,0.9),(0.65,0.95)]

    intervals5 = [(0.45,0.85),(0.5,0.9),(0.55,0.95)]
    
	\item For a interval, try different number of simple for LSE-backtrack. I have tried number of simple: $10,20,\dots,100$
