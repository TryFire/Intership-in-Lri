\subsection*{Modify LSE-backtrack in Paper}
I have compared the code of LSE-backtrack with algorithm LSE-backtrack, I am sure that they are the same except that in the code, there is a bound of research (A, B) while there isn't a bound in the paper. Stephan told that in the code we are more of less obliged to impose bound, if we test on real data, usually the function of reword is not defined outside the bound, so it is arbitrary.


\subsection*{Execute for Google cluster data}
I have executed algorithms for Google cluster data for more rounds to achieve that the curve become more smooth.
